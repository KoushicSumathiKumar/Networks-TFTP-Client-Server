# Computer Networks Coursework
This repositorie contains my **Computer Networks** module coursework which I took as part of my Computer Science Degree during my second year at The **University of Sussex**.

I have implemented the **Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)** as defined in [RFC 1350](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1350.txt) as the requirement mentioned in this coursework.

The objective was to implement both the client and server of the protocol and to create a **UDP version** of the server and client as well as a **TCP version** of the server and client to show our understandings of networking.

I decided to make a **simple console based Client-Server** for this coursework which my final score was 83 out of 100.

# Folder Structure

- **TFTP-TCP-Client** - TCP implementation of the TFTP client
- **TFTP-TCP-Server** - TCP implementation of the TFTP server
- **TFTP-UDP-Client** - UDP implementation of the TFTP client
- **TFTP-UDP-Server** - UDP implementation of the TFTP server
- **report.pdf** - my report summarising my methods and results building Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)


In order to properly test **my Client-Servers**, I used [Tftp64](https://pjo2.github.io/tftpd64/) to test with 3rd party client-server. Proof of **my Client-Servers** working is recorded in my report.
